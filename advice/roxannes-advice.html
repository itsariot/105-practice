                <h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
                <p>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Keep going until you get it!</p>

                <p>Practice makes perfect. You can't get better if you don't practice and try to do better each time.</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to take breaks.</h4>
                <p>Never underestimate taking a break and giving your mind a rest. If you're struggling and just can't get it, get up and take a walk, make some tea, let your brain unwind and relax.</p>

                <p>Sometimes we want to keep pushing ourselves and while that can help sometimes, giving your mind a rest allows you to come back to the project with a fresh mindset.</p>

                <p>Look at you now, here you are working on writing code! Could you do this yesterday? No... so you're already improving aren't you? Keep up the good work, you're awesome!</p>
